For organizations requiring enhanced security and control, Panacea supports private deployments. Agents can run within your own servers or secure cloud environments, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Security**: Protect sensitive data within your controlled environment, minimizing exposure risks.
- **Custom Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Panacea with internal systems, databases, and third-party applications.
- **Dedicated Resources**: Allocate resources based on organizational needs, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.
- **Compliance Assurance**: Meet industry-specific compliance and regulatory requirements with tailored solutions.

## Deployment Options

- **On-Premise Servers**: Install Panacea on your own hardware infrastructure for maximum control and security.
- **Secure Cloud Environments**: Deploy within trusted cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) with robust security measures.
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Combine on-premise and cloud deployments to leverage the benefits of both environments, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

## Deployment Steps

   - Set up role-based access controls (RBAC) to manage user and agent permissions effectively.

4. **Integrate Systems**
   - Connect Panacea with existing enterprise systems, databases, and APIs to enable seamless data flow and functionality.
   - Utilize the Developer API for custom integrations and automation.

5. **Deploy Agents**
   - Launch and manage agents within the private environment through the enterprise UI or API.
   - Monitor agent performance and resource usage to ensure optimal operation.

## Best Practices

- **Data Encryption**: Always encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to safeguard against unauthorized access.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and compliance checks to ensure adherence to industry standards.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement robust backup and disaster recovery plans to protect against data loss and ensure business continuity.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Utilize logging and monitoring tools to track system performance and receive alerts for any anomalies or issues.
